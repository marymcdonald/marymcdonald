###Hi, Iâ€™m Mary âœ¨

I'm a software developer based in Montreal & Toronto, Canada. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

Recently, I created [Sundial](https://github.com/Project-Sundial) with my teammates [David](https://github.com/davidscoding), [Jacob](https://github.com/Jacob-Clark-809), and [Sofia](https://github.com/sofalere). Sundial a self-hosted, open-source cron job monitoring and management system that can operate across one or multiple nodes.
